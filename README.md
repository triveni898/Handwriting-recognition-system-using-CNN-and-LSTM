This project presents a Python-based implementation of a machine learning model to predict student performance using classification techniques. It involves preprocessing student data, feature selection, and applying multiple classifiers like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. The project aims to identify factors affecting academic outcomes and help institutions take early action to support at-risk students.

Key steps include:

Importing and preprocessing the dataset

Feature engineering and correlation analysis

Splitting the data for training and testing

Building and evaluating classification models

Comparing accuracy and performance of each model

The notebook is designed for academic and research use and serves as a base for further development in educational data mining.
