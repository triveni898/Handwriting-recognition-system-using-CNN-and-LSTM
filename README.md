This project implements a deep learning-based Handwriting Recognition System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It is designed to recognize handwritten text sequences from image data, combining CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence modeling.

The notebook contains the complete pipeline:

📦 Dataset loading and preprocessing (image resizing, normalization)

🧠 CNN model for spatial feature extraction

🔁 LSTM layers for sequential data processing

🏷️ CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss for aligning predictions with text

📊 Model training, evaluation, and accuracy analysis

This system can be used as a base for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) applications where handwritten text needs to be digitized or classified.
